# Full-Beam-Analysis-with-MATLAB-GUI
Full beam analysis with user interface for teaching purposes with diagram plots for Beam Deflection, Moment, and Shear Force  along with Beam's schematic. Different kinds of beam supports and loads are available to be applied to materials of different types. Then, after running the analysis you will get the corresponding plots along with information about whether the tensile, shear, or the compressive stresses applied to the beam will cause it to fail or not. Moreover, different cross sections for the beam are available for you to choose from. This is an exceptionally useful tool for fast learning and teaching purposes.
